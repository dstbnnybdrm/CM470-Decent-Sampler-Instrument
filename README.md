# Casio SA-35 Decent Sampler instrument

## description

a Decent Sampler instrument of all (except one) of the base tones on the Casio
SA-35 keyboard, also released by Radioshack as the Realistic Concertmate-470. i
picked this keyboard up at a thrift store a couple of years ago and fell in love
with it! just super charming and nostalgic sounding.

the sounds were recorded DI using the provided headphone jack with some minor
noise reduction to tame some noise/static. i provided ATTACK and RELEASE
controls that aren't on the actual keyboard. for certain sustained sounds there
are also two "RELEASE MODES" provided, SAMPLE and ENVELOPE, which works as
followed:

- SAMPLE: on note release a built-in release sample is played (usually a kind
  of reverb/delay tail, etc.). the RELEASE knob then controls the length
  of this release sample. this will be more faithful to how the actual
  keyboard sounds.
- ENVELOPE: the note release is controlled via a typical release envelope.
  the RELEASE knob then controls how long the release will last.

## usage

to use just simply extract the `.zip` file's contents and place the `.dslibrary`
file in the folder you keep all of your Decent Sample samples and libraries.
from there you can find it in Decent Sampler's file browser!
