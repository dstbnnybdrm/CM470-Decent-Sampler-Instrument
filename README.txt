⚘ FOREWORD & DESCRIPTION ⚘

thank you so much for downloading! i appreciate the support!

(this is a Decent Sampler instrument, if you don't have Decent Sampler you can
download it for free here:
https://www.decentsamples.com/product/decent-sampler-plugin/)

this is a sampler instrument of all the base tones (excluding one) on the
Casio SA-35/Concertmate-470, a cute little toy keyboard that i thrifted one
day. i love the way this lil thing sounds, it's a lot of fun just playing
around with it. the samples were recorded using the headphone out on the back of
the keyboard straight to my audio interface. the only processing done was some
minor noise reduction to tame some harsh static-y sounds in the high end.

all sounds can be manipulated using the ATTACK and RELEASE knobs. for certain
sustained sounds there are two RELEASE MODES provided: "SAMPLE" and "ENVELOPE".
they work as followed:

    SAMPLE: on note release a built-in release sample is played (usually a kind
        of reverb tail, etc.). this mode is more faithful to how the actual
        keyboard sounds. the RELEASE knob then controls the length of this
        release sample.
    ENVELOPE: the note release is controlled via a typical release envelope. the
        RELEASE knob then controls how long the release will last.
