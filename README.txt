this is a sampler instrument of all the base tones (excluding one) on the
Casio SA-35/Concertmate-470, a cute little toy keyboard that i thrifted one
day. i love the way this lil thing sounds, it's a lot of fun just playing
around with it. the samples were recorded using the headphone out on the back of
the keyboard straight to my audio interface. the only processing done was some
minor noise reduction to tame some harsh static-y sounds in the high end.

provided are some controls for the attack and release parameters. some sounds
have unique, built-in release samples.
